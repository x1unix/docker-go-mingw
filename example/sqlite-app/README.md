# SQLite App Example

This is an example app which requires CGO and MinGW toolchain to be built for Windows (see [issue](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/issues/303)).

Code is taken from [mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/blob/master/_example/simple/simple.go)

Run `make win` to make application for windows
